I've tried to make this comprehensive, but we may need to make adjustments as we encounter different scenarios during the development process.
Please review this specification, Mike, and let me know if you have any suggestions or require further clarification on any of the features. Once we agree on this, I'll proceed with the implementation of the Node Encoder architectures.


### **Agents**
In our MFC project, **agents** refer to **Cellular Automata (CAs)** and specialized **AI-based agents** that work within the system to perform tasks, make decisions, and interact in the environment based on the goals and feedback they receive from the **Master Feedback Controller (MFC)**. Here’s a breakdown of the different types of agents you can engage with and their roles:

---

### **1. Cellular Automata (CAs)**
These are individual units that operate based on local rules and interactions with their neighboring agents in the "grid" or environment. Each CA agent follows a set of predefined behaviors and can dynamically adapt based on the rules provided by the MFC.

#### **Key CA Agents:**
- **ResourceAllocationCA:** Manages resource allocation, such as CPU, memory, or bandwidth.
- **OnboardingCA:** Handles the assignment and organization of new agents joining the system.
- **MarketingCA:** A CA that performs simulations related to strategic marketing objectives, like campaign evaluation.

You can interact with these CA agents to:
- Send them tasks.
- Observe their behaviors (e.g., oscillatory, resource-dependent).
- Query their internal states (current resource usage, task status).

#### **Examples of Engagement with CAs:**
- **"What is your current resource allocation?"** — You’ll receive a response with their resource levels.
- **"Increase task priority!"** — You can send a command to update their local priorities.

These agents receive rules and directives from the MFC and can negotiate or report their progress and needs.

---

### **2. **Rule-Based Agents (ElicitorAgent & RuleDistributorAgent)**
These agents are responsible for interpreting and distributing rules:
- **ElicitorAgent:** Extracts key structured data (goals, metrics, constraints) from unstructured text input and clarifies missing pieces.
- **RuleDistributorAgent:** Takes rules generated by the MFC and sends them to the appropriate CAs.

#### **Examples of Engagement:**
- **You:** "What rule is currently being distributed to CA1?"
- **RuleDistributorAgent:** "The rule is to monitor a sudden spike in resource consumption and issue alerts."

---

### **3. Specialized AI Agents (Cognitive Agents):**
These agents handle more complex, higher-level tasks such as:
- Analyzing patterns (e.g., anomalous data patterns).
- Making strategic decisions (e.g., resource reallocation in case of failures).
- Communicating insights and reasoning with the MFC.

#### **Types of Specialized Agents:**
- **Analysis Agents:** Perform pattern recognition and anomaly detection.
- **Coordination Agents:** Help organize the flow of tasks and communication between groups of agents.
- **Execution Agents:** Carry out specific actions and report results.

---

### **How to Engage with Agents:**

You can interact with the agents by:
1. **Sending Commands:** Issue commands for specific actions (e.g., "reallocate resources," "report anomaly status").
2. **Querying States:** Ask for the current state or feedback from an agent (e.g., "What is your current state?").
3. **Observing Simulation:** Run the simulation environment and observe how agents respond to different scenarios.
4. **Rule Negotiation:** Engage with the system to update, clarify, or override rules (e.g., "Add a new constraint to Task X").

---

### **Agent Example Interaction:**
1. **You:** "ResourceAllocationCA, how are you distributing CPU resources?"
2. **ResourceAllocationCA:** "I am allocating 4 CPU cores to CA1, 2 cores to CA2, and 1 core to CA3 based on priority scores."

3. **You:** "OnboardingCA, what's the status of new agents joining the system?"
4. **OnboardingCA:** "3 new agents have been assigned to the 'Data Analysis' group and are awaiting further instructions."

---

### **Why Your Engagement is Critical:**
By engaging with the agents, you can:
- Ensure the system is meeting its goals (e.g., resource efficiency, fault tolerance).
- Observe and fine-tune agent behaviors and rules to adapt to evolving scenarios.
- Test different topologies, rules, and configurations for optimal performance.
