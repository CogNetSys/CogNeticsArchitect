## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the development environment, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or higher, macOS Catalina or higher, or a modern Linux distribution.
- **Python Version:** Python 3.8 or higher.
- **Package Manager:** `pip` should be installed and updated.
- **Git:** Installed for version control and repository management.

### Installing Dependencies

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine. Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of our GitHub repository.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

   It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage project-specific dependencies.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Upgrade pip**

   Ensure that `pip` is up-to-date.

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

4. **Install Required Python Packages**

   Install all necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *If `requirements.txt` is not available, install dependencies manually:*

   ```bash
   pip install sentence-transformers numpy pandas torch scikit-learn networkx pytest
   ```

### Configuring Environment Variables

Certain components of the MFC require API keys and other sensitive information. It's essential to configure these securely.

1. **Create a `.env` File**

   In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env`.

2. **Add Environment Variables**

   Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add the following variables:

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   # Add other environment variables as needed
   ```

   *Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.*

3. **Load Environment Variables**

   Ensure that your Python scripts are set up to load environment variables from the `.env` file. You can use the `python-dotenv` package for this purpose.

   ```bash
   pip install python-dotenv
   ```

   *In your Python scripts, add:*

   ```python
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   import os

   load_dotenv()
   openai_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
   ```

---

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests with Pytest

We use `pytest` for running unit tests to ensure code reliability and functionality.

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Ensure you're in the root directory of the project.

   ```bash
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Run All Tests**

   Execute the following command to run all unit tests:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

3. **Run Specific Tests**

   To run tests for a specific module, use:

   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_node_encoder.py
   ```

4. **Viewing Test Coverage (Optional)**

   For a comprehensive overview of test coverage, install `pytest-cov`:

   ```bash
   pip install pytest-cov
   ```

   Then, run:

   ```bash
   pytest --cov=mfc
   ```

   *This will generate a coverage report indicating which parts of the codebase are tested.*

## Simulation

### Running the Simulation

The simulation environment allows us to test the interactions between the MFC and the Cellular Automata (CAs) under various scenarios.

1. **Ensure Dependencies are Installed**

   Make sure all dependencies are installed and environment variables are configured as per the [Environment Setup](#environment-setup) section.

2. **Prepare Configuration Files**

   If the simulation requires specific configurations (e.g., number of CAs, resource allocations), ensure that the relevant configuration files (like `config.yaml` or `config.json`) are set up correctly.

3. **Execute the Simulation Script**

   Run the simulation using the provided script.

   ```bash
   python simulation.py
   ```

   *If the simulation script accepts command-line arguments for customization, refer to the script's documentation or use the `--help` flag:*

   ```bash
   python simulation.py --help
   ```

4. **Monitor Simulation Output**

   The simulation will output logs and results to the console and log files (if configured). Review these outputs to assess the system's performance and behavior.

## Usage Examples

### Using the NodeEncoder

The `NodeEncoder` is a core module responsible for encoding agent and task data into numerical embeddings suitable for analysis and decision-making.

1. **Importing the NodeEncoder**

   ```python
   from mfc.encoders.node_encoder import NodeEncoder
   ```

2. **Initializing the NodeEncoder**

   ```python
   encoder = NodeEncoder(model_name='all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
   ```

3. **Encoding Agent Data**

   ```python
   agent_data = {
       "Base Model": "GPT-4",
       "Role/Expertise": "Programmer",
       "Available Plugins/Tools": ["Python Compiler", "Web Searcher"],
       "Expertise Level": "Expert",
       "Current State": {
           "Task": 5,
           "Resources": 3
       },
       "Current Workload": 7,
       "Reliability Score": 0.95,
       "Latency": 0.2,
       "Error Rate": 0.01,
       "Cost Per Task": 0.5
   }

   agent_embedding = encoder.encode_agent(agent_data)
   print("Agent Embedding:", agent_embedding)
   ```

4. **Encoding Task Data**

   ```python
   task_data = {
       "Type": "Code Generation",
       "Priority": "High",
       "Dependencies": ["Task1", "Task2"],
       "Resource Requirements": {
           "CPU": 2,
           "Memory": 4,
           "Storage": 10
       },
       "Computational Complexity": 0.8,
       "Memory Footprint": 256,
       "Urgency Score": 9.0,
       "Expected Value": 100.0,
       "Data Locality": "Cloud",
       "Security Level": "Confidential",
       "Precedence Relations": ["Task1 -> Task3"]
   }

   task_embedding = encoder.encode_task(task_data)
   print("Task Embedding:", task_embedding)
   ```

5. **Running the Usage Example**

   Save the above code snippets in a Python script, for example, `examples/node_encoder_example.py`, and execute it:

   ```bash
   python examples/node_encoder_example.py
   ```

   *This will display the generated embeddings for the provided agent and task data.*

### Using the FeedbackAggregator

The `FeedbackAggregator` collects and processes feedback from all CAs, integrating anomaly detection to ensure system reliability.

1. **Importing Necessary Modules**

   ```python
   from mfc.modules.feedback_aggregator import FeedbackAggregator
   from mfc.modules.deephydra_anomaly_detector import DeepHYDRAAnomalyDetector
   ```

2. **Initializing the Anomaly Detector and Feedback Aggregator**

   ```python
   # Initialize DeepHYDRA Anomaly Detector
   anomaly_detector = DeepHYDRAAnomalyDetector(model_path='path_to_deephydra_model')

   # Initialize FeedbackAggregator with the anomaly detector
   aggregator = FeedbackAggregator(anomaly_detector=anomaly_detector)
   ```

3. **Aggregating Feedback**

   ```python
   feedback_list = [
       {"unique_id": "CA1", "state": 5, "resource": 3},
       {"unique_id": "CA2", "state": 7, "resource": 4},
       {"unique_id": "CA3", "state": 2, "resource": 1},
       # Add more feedback as needed
   ]

   aggregated_feedback = aggregator.aggregate_feedback(feedback_list)
   print("Aggregated Feedback:", aggregated_feedback)
   ```

4. **Running the Usage Example**

   Save the above code in a Python script, for example, `examples/feedback_aggregator_example.py`, and execute it:

   ```bash
   python examples/feedback_aggregator_example.py
   ```

   *This will display the aggregated feedback along with any detected anomalies.*

## Additional Notes

- **Virtual Environment Activation:** Remember to activate your virtual environment each time you start a new terminal session.

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **Deactivating the Virtual Environment:** When you're done working, deactivate the virtual environment.

  ```bash
  deactivate
  ```

- **Updating Dependencies:** To update the project dependencies, modify the `requirements.txt` file and run:

  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
  ```

- **Contributing to the Project:** Ensure that all code contributions follow the project's coding standards and pass all unit tests before merging.
